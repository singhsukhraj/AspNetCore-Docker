Install static binaries
Download the static binary archive. Go to https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/ (or change stable to nightly or test), choose your hardware platform, and download the .tgz file relating to the version of Docker Engine - Community you want to install.

Extract the archive using the tar utility. The dockerd and docker binaries are extracted.

$ tar xzvf /path/to/<FILE>.tar.gz
Optional: Move the binaries to a directory on your executable path, such as /usr/bin/. If you skip this step, you must provide the path to the executable when you invoke docker or dockerd commands.

$ sudo cp docker/* /usr/local/bin/
Start the Docker daemon:

$ sudo dockerd &
If you need to start the daemon with additional options, modify the above command accordingly or create and edit the file /etc/docker/daemon.json to add the custom configuration options.

Verify that Docker is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

$ sudo docker run hello-world
This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.

To create the docker group and add your user:

Create the docker group.

$ sudo groupadd docker
Add your user to the docker group.

$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

If testing on a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for changes to take effect.

On a desktop Linux environment such as X Windows, log out of your session completely and then log back in.

On Linux, you can also run the following command to activate the changes to groups:

$ newgrp docker 
Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo.

$ docker run hello-world
This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.
